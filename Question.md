# Questions in handouts

1. **Differential Kinematics** :

    Condition number of the Jacobian. This number tells us how close the Jacobian is to loosing rank (having its determinant equal to 0).The ideal and lowest possible value of the condition number is 1; <ins>*once the condition number starts reaching large values the robot is approaching a singularity*.</ins>

    ***What does this sentence mean? When condition number is larger than 1, the robot will approach a singularity?***

    Figure the answer out in the last part of this handout :

    <ins>* the closer the condition number of the Jacobian is close to 1, the **FARTHER** the robot is from a singularity. </ins>
